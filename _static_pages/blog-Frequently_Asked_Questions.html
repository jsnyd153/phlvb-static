										If you’re planning more than a couple times a year, we
										recommend purchasing a membership which will give you
										discounts on all Philadelphia Volleyball events.
									</p>
									<p>
										The basic membership gets you $2 off every pickup event. The
										friends and family gets you $2 off every pickup event for
										you and any guests you sign up for. The basic membership
										costs $10.95 so if you think you’ll go to more than 5 events
										per year, we recommend purchasing a membership.

										We encourage our members to honestly declare their skill
										level on their OpenSports profile. That is usually enough
										for most players to only attend events appropriate for them,
										however levels are self reported. If a player is
										consistently performing below the target skill level for an
										event, the organizer may ask them to attend lower level
										events instead.
									</p>
									<p>
										If you’re unsure of your skill level, start low, and if the
										event is below your level multiple times (or below your
										level by a wie margin), play up a level and repeat till you
										feel satisfied with the play. It’s much harder to move
										upwards if an organizer needs to ask you to attend lower
										level events.
									</p>
									<p>
										As a group that organizes events for the public we cannot
										guarantee the skill level will always be perfect, and it
										will likely fluctuate a bit from week to week depending on
										players interest an availability. We try our best to keep
										the average level of even ts close to what they are labeled.
