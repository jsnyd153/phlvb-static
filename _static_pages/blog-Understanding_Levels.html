						<h2>Why levels matter</h2>
						<p>
							Making sure you are the proper level for an event is important for ensuring everyone stays safe and has a good time, but they can be confusing if you’re new to volleyball.
						</p>
						<p>
							From a fun perspective, it is important for players to have the level of play they expect. Everyone can have fun playign volleyball regardless of their level, but it can get dicey when the gap in skills levels get to far apart. Loosing over and over isn’t fun, and on the flipside, not getting to have long rallies isn't fun. Some events may have a wider range or all skill levels and tend to be more of a learning environment, but for many events having a relatively even skill level makes it more fun for everyone involved..
						</p>
						<p>
							From a safety perspective, volleyball can be a fast paced game and having high level players spiking the ball at lower level players, or having players running into each other or contacting each other under the net can be unsafe.

							This is the general ranking system used in the region, for tournaments and pickup.

						<p>
							While all versions of volleyball use the same core skills, there are slightly different descriptions for indoor(sixes) and doubles (doubles) since they prioritize different things — i.e. doubles (outdoors) prioritizes being a well rounded player and taking smart shots compared to sixes (indoor) prioritizes being more specialized and hitting with power.

										B level players are still in the early learning stages of the game but knows the skills. They understand the basic concepts of the game and try to get 3 touches on the ball each play. They know how to bump, set (a little), and spike, but have a lot of practice yet to go to be able to do these skills consistently. A "B" player makes mistakes often.

                                        B players are not beginners, but are still learning the game. They should have a basic understanding of the how to play doubles but are still inconsistent in their core skills. They can set their partner, but many of their sets may be technically doubles contacts, or may be limited to bump setting. Teams should be able to get 3 contacts on the ball, but many plays result in either rolling or bumping the ball.
                                    </p>

										BB players knows where to be on the court at all times when plays are developing. They know the footwork of and how to approach hitting effectively from an assigned position. A "BB" player knows how to run a 5-1 (or 6-2), and play a position in these systems.
                                    </p>
									<p>Some events might differentiate between <b>Upper</b> and <b>Lower</b> BB</p>
									<p>Upper BB is 80% consistent at every skill point (serving, passing, setting, and hitting.) You should be able to effectively play your position, not just know how. Players are hitting the ball hard at this level so front row players should be able to block at the net.</p>

                                        BB players are can execute all skills well (serving, receiving, setting, hitting) but vary in their consistency. They should be able to serve receive consistently and should have a strong understanding of defensive positioning and blocking calls. Hand sets should be clean (and you should have the ability to recognize double contacts.)

									<p>Some events might differentiate between <b>Upper</b> and <b>Lower</b> BB</p>
                                    <p>
										The core difference between Upper BB and Lower BB is the level of consistency and athleticism. Lower BB may have an understanding of how to play doubles, but are only executing on the core skills ~50-60% of the time and may be physically more limited. At the Upper BB you should be doing most skills well 70-80% of the time and have the athleticism to effectively cover the court and execute a large range of offensive tactics.
