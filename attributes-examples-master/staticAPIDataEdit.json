		"description": "# Indoor Quads\nThis event will be Coed Quads format. We will have 3 teams per court, rotating through (each team will play 2 games then sit for 1).\n\n**This event is intended for BB or higher level players.**\n\nBB players can execute all skills well (serving, receiving, setting, hitting) but vary in their consistency. They usually will get 3 touches each play, have a good understanding of positioning, and are consistent in their serves, passes, and attacks. They know the basic footwork and how to approach hitting effectively from an assigned position. You should be able to consistently serve receive for this event.\n\n🔞 You must be 18 years of age or older to participate.\n\n## Rules\n + Games will be rally to 21, win by 2, Cap at 23.\n + No rotation required however you must serve in order\n + Hand setting/pushing the ball over the net is NOT permitted\n + No open hand tips/dinks\n + No directional blocking (redirecting the ball with fingertips)\n + A player may cross under the net as long as they do not make contact with the net or interfere with the opponent's play. (If you pass under the net while blocking/hitting/jousting and there is a player attempting to play the ball on the other side, it is a fault. You do not need to contact a player for it to be considered interference)\n\n---\n\n### 📛 MEMBERSHIP\n We have two annual membership plans, one $10 plan which saves $2 on your ticket, and a second $15 plan that saves $2 on your ticket and $2 for every guest ticket. Visit the group link under this event's title, then visit the membership tab.\n\n### 📝 WAITLIST\nIs this event full? Join the waitlist, it's free! Curious how the waitlist works? Read this:\n https://opensports.net/waitlist\n\n---\n\n## Understanding Levels:\n\nOur organizers can only evaluate people once they see them play at an event, so we rely on members self reporting their level. Understanding what level you are, and accurately self reporting it, is vital for helping us keep our pickup events fun and safe for everyone. When rating yourself, remember to rate yourself against the descriptions, rather than other people who you've seen at events. The level of attendees at individual events can fluctuate.\n\n`Beginner --> B --> BB --> A --> AA --> Open`\n\n#### Beginner Level (Recreational)\n\n\"Beginner\" players are playing recreational level volleyball. They're still learning how to play and the focus is keeping the ball in the air and getting the ball back over the net rather than getting 3 touches and bump/set/spike.\n\n\n\n#### B Level\n\n\"B\" players are not beginners, but are still in the early learning stages of the game. They can maintain a rally, have a basic understanding of positioning and try to get 3 touches on the ball each play. They know how to bump, set (a little), and spike, but need a lot of practice to be able to do these skills consistently. They should already be getting a good pass at least 30% of the time when receiving a serve. Players aren’t necessarily specialized into positions yet, so most games will either have the player in the middle front setting, or sometimes running a 4-2 system (2 setters across from each other, each setting when they are in the front row).\n\n**_B level is the lowest level of competition, but it is still a level of competition at most tournaments. B is not the same as Beginner._**\n\n#### BB Level\n\nBB players can execute all skills well (serving, receiving, setting, hitting) but vary in their consistency. They usually will get 3 touches each play, have a good understanding of positioning and rotations, and are consistent in their serves, passes, and attacks. They know the basic footwork and how to approach hitting effectively from an assigned position. BB players will begin to specialize a bit, know how to run a 5-1 (or 6-2), and can play a position in these systems.\n\nSome events might differentiate between **Upper BB** and **Lower BB**.\n\nThe core differences between **Upper BB** and **Lower BB** is the level of consistency and athleticism. Lower BB may only be executing on the core skills roughly 50-60% (serving, passing, setting, and hitting) of the time  and/or may be physically more limited. At the Upper BB level you should be able to effectively play your position, not just generally know where to be, and are 70-80% consistent at all the core skills. Specific positions may have slightly different requirements, for example an Upper BB Libero has a higher expectation for passing than other positions. Players are hitting the ball harder at this level so front row players should be able to block at the net.\n\n#### A Level\n\nA level players have the skills needed to play at a high level. They are in excellent physical condition and can do all the skills required of their position very consistently — Liberos/OHs are giving a good (3 point) pass on most plays, front row players are able to both effectively hit and block, Setters can effectively run all options on offense and deliver the ball to their hitters consistently...etc\n\nThey have in-depth knowledge of offensive and defensive game play. Many of these players are former club and/or college athletes.\n\n\n#### AA Level\n\nAA players are superb athletes who execute their skills with the highest of power and efficiency. Most of these players played in college at D1/D2 school and are still in peak physical condition. This is the last stop before becoming a \"Pro\" or \"Open Level\" player.",
